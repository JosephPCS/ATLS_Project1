# Project Proposal  
**Hawaiian Local Motion**  
*Joseph Pleasant, Nathan Khazam*  

## Interaction Description  
**Interaction: Grounded Local motion** 
-This interaction is all about how users can traverse seens while staying in a stationary position. This type of motion looks to avoid a need for spatial awareness and is playable in restricted spaces.


### Ideas for Interaction:  
Below is a list of interaction concepts we aim to implement:

#### General Ideas:
- **Teleport - kunai** ✔️  
- **Thor's hammer** ✔️  
- **Grappling hook** ✔️  
- **Joystick (backup)** ✔️  
- **Laser vision with head movement** ✔️  
    - Push back from shooting (small amount of movement) ✔️  
- **Teleport with lock** (maybe)  
- **Sword lunge** (maybe, similar to others) ❌  
- **Push back with throwing an object**  
- **Thrusters** (same mechanic as the push back)  
- **Conveyor belt / moving sidewalk** ✔️  
- **Ladder** ❌  
- **Superman arm to move** (maybe)  

## Storyboards  
Each interaction will have a short storyboard that shows how we envision them to play out. These will include hand-drawn stick figures that represent the movement and interaction mechanics.

---

## Checklist  
- Each movement has its own scene.
- Five scenes in total.
- A teleport pad will be available at the end of each scene to move between scenes.

### Movement Implementations:
- **Joystick Movement**  
- **Conveyor Belt**  
    - Potentially include a spawner.  
- **Thor’s Hammer**  
- **Thrusters (lasers)**  
- **Teleport kunai**


# Pre-test Questions
- Do you know what local motion is?
    - 60% of users knew what local motion was and could properly give an accurate description. 40% did not know the interaction by its given name.
- Have you ever used VR or things that produce this local motion, like kinect or WII?
- if so what did you like about those systems?
    -Majority of users liked the simplicity of the wii. It was a system that at its core used stationary movement, but used physical action to create a more dynamic experience.
    -For the people who refered to the kinect, they talked about the freedom due to it primarily being a motion sensor, but at the same time it made movemnt clunky depending on the sensor location so it was not as precise.
-If not what are your intial thoughts or fears about this interaction?
    -Each user had used one of the previous stated machines, so there was no responses for this question.

# Post-test Questions
-What interaction was the most intriguing?
Out of the users we had 4 people say the kunai, 1 person said thors, and another said the conveyor.
-How was the control on the interactions?
    -All users said the control between interactions was smooth and easy to use.
-How intuitive was it to progress through each interaction level?
    -All users said once they understood the interaction, it was easy to proceed through the levels.
    -However most had declared that their definently was a need for instruction, basic human curisotiy can only take you so far when put into a fabricated space.
    - The level design connected well with the interaction.

 

### Interations and Descriptions:
- **Joystick Movement** 
    -User will use the joystick on the right hand controller to move around the scene. The user needs to use their head to help control the direction of where they went want to travel.
- **Conveyor Belt**  
    - A conveyor belt with a cube that hovers of the conveyor. The cube tells the user what direction the converyor will take you. 
- **Thor’s Hammer**  
    -User picks up a hammer assest in order to move around the scene. The speed of traversal is determined by how close the controller is to the players body. If its closer than you move slower, farther you move faster.
- **Thrusters**  
    -Both controllers are now used as thrusters, similar to how Iron Man flies. When you press the triggers you will burst in the oposite direction of where you hold the controller. For example: If you want to move forward, point the controllers behind you and press the triggers.
- **Teleport kunai**
    -Users are given black rods to grab and throw around the map. Wherever the rod lands you teleport too. 

### Observations and Insights for Each Interaction
- **Joystick Movement**  
    - Users easily progress through this level with ease. There is a lot of head movement going on, so if the headset was tethered, that could present an issue. Also it could be disorienting after a while to constantly have to keep turning your head.
    - potentially add a second hand for some form of dual controller movement and turning.

    # Reflection
    We wanted to create an immediate comfortable interaction that users were familar with. The head turning was supposed to be the special VR twist to defeat the user remaning completly still and only using the joystick.

- **Conveyor Belt** 
    -Users progressed through this level the quickest. Not much visible movement. Slight head turns for when they have to change conveyors, but not the same degree as the joystick movement
    -Some users did not like the idea of it being a completely guided experience. The idea of moving without having control, or physically moving in space presented a werid experience for them
    -Shows how humans would like to have a form of autonomy when they know it is availbe. 
    - Users also used joystick on this level more than what was intended.

     # Reflection
     We thought for this one the users would enjoy a more stationary experience. The thought was to create a Sonic the Hedgehog esque grind system from a first person perspective. We thought the users would take the time to look around the map as they slide along the conveyors.

- **Thor’s Hammer**  
    -Users naturally experiemented with speed control without instruction, most were able to figure it out pretty quickly.
    -one user didn't notice a difference
    - Users tried to fly with the hammer, forgetting that the interaction is grounded based. This could be because of the reference to Thor and their understanding of the character.
    - users would try to find a way to stop but there was not a set way.

     # Reflection
     We wanted the user to interact with the scene in a way that created this swerving arm motion as they moved through the poles on the map. This would allow for minimal body movement and an interesting speed experience.
- **Thrusters**  
    - Users had the most difficulty with this level
    - level design issues also helped create a clunky experience. 
    Users needed some guidance on how to internalize how to use the thrusters
    -most tried to hold the triggers instead of clicking it for a burst
    -Users were able to use the interation intuitively if told to think of how Iron Man flies
    -Most looked for some form of asset to signify that they had thrusters
    -users used joystick to help keep them in check
        -remove joystick from this level

     # Reflection
     Originally, the idea was for the user to use the thrusters for an explosive side step like experience.  With inspiration from Iron Man and making the decision to do burst instead of constant movement, we  thought users woudl go against their intuition and enjoy a jittery experience.
- **Teleport kunai**
    -Users actually performed well despite this being our most complex interaction
    -the progression through the level was quick
    -Users would show slightly jarred motion off first contact due to the idea that they just teleported into a wall
    - users displayed comfortability with aiming

     # Reflection
     This was an ode to Minato from Naruto, and we wanted to take the telportation that was used in earlier assigments and revamp it so users can move around differently. We thought users would have a fun time aiming the rod and having a 360 expierience with traversing the scene.
