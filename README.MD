# Project Proposal  
**Hawaiian Local Motion**  
*Joseph Pleasant, Nathan Khazam*  

## Interaction Description  
**Interaction: Grounded Locomotion**  

### Ideas for Interaction:  
Below is a list of interaction concepts we aim to implement:

#### General Ideas:
- **Teleport - kunai** ✔️  
- **Thor's hammer** ✔️  
- **Grappling hook** ✔️  
- **Joystick (backup)** ✔️  
- **Laser vision with head movement** ✔️  
    - Push back from shooting (small amount of movement) ✔️  
- **Teleport with lock** (maybe)  
- **Sword lunge** (maybe, similar to others) ❌  
- **Push back with throwing an object**  
- **Thrusters** (same mechanic as the push back)  
- **Conveyor belt / moving sidewalk** ✔️  
- **Ladder** ❌  
- **Superman arm to move** (maybe)  

## Storyboards  
Each interaction will have a short storyboard that shows how we envision them to play out. These will include hand-drawn stick figures that represent the movement and interaction mechanics.

---

## Checklist  
- Each movement has its own scene.
- Five scenes in total.
- A teleport pad will be available at the end of each scene to move between scenes.

### Movement Implementations:
- **Joystick Movement**  
- **Conveyor Belt**  
    - Potentially include a spawner.  
- **Thor’s Hammer**  
- **Thrusters (lasers)**  
- **Teleport kunai**
